### General info
This project includes all the code demos of on-class exercise and instance trainning, as well as notes for the 3-day learning.    
Codes are in English version.  
Notes are in Chinese version.    
User can find some basic machine learning models and deployment inside this project, but if you want to find more deep knowledge in machine learning filed, this project is totally too simple, it is more suitable for a starting learning user.  
1. day1_demos includes each on-class small exercises for day1 to let user know the basic concept and deployment of ML models  
2. day2_demos includes each on-class small exercises for day2 to let user know the basic concept and deployment of ML models  
3. day3_demos includes each on-class small exercises for day3 to let user know the basic concept and deployment of ML models   
4. other instance file includes more comprehensive deployment of thaat whole day's knowledge
